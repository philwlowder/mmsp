Morrow Mountain State Park Needs Volunteers for Old Fashion Day Sunday, November 1

We are seeking help with our annual festival “Old Fashion Day” on Sunday, November 1. 
We will have exhibits and demonstrations including: goldpanning, flintknapping, woodworking, 
kids’ games and bluegrass music. We need additional volunteers that have “old fashion” skills 
they would be willing to share with our visitors. Blacksmiths, farriers, soap makers and quilters
 are just a few of the volunteers we would like to find and demonstrate their skills. Old Fashion Day 
 is our attempt to expose people to a way of life that has largely disappeared and to remind visitors 
 of what life was like for previous generations.

We also need volunteers to help “man” both demonstrations and exhibits.
 We can provide the materials for a variety of activities if we can get volunteers to facilitate 
 them. Unfortunately, our limited staff will be busy helping set up, control traffic and run the park’s 
 operations and will not have time to lead these activities. Some of the demonstrations we need help
 with include: fire making, children’s games, throwing spears with an atlatl, candle making, 
 use of a crosscut saw, and cider making. It does not matter if you have experience in these 
 areas as we can easily train you to lead any of them. If you like working with people, 
 especially children, you should have a great time teaching and interacting with a wide variety 
 of visitors. Old Fashion Day goes from 1-5 p.m. and we would like to find volunteers that can 
 commit for the afternoon.
